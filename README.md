# Furever 
Using the Petfinder and Google Maps APIs we created a site that took user input and returned adoptable dogs near the user. Our goal was to display results in a way that wasn't overwhelming to the user as well as eliminate the need to go to multiple shelter's sites to view dogs available for adoption. By limiting the amount of results a user views at once we hope that the user spends more time and pays more attention to the individual dogs which increases the likelihood of adoption. 
Our results are structured in individual cards that the user can click through. Each card has information about the dog as well as a google map with a marker on their location. All pets marked with a full heart will be added to the favorites page for later review. The favorites page includes a cluster map of the locations of the dogs favorited.
